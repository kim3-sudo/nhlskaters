# NHL Skaters Data - 2021-22 Season
## Kenyon Sports Analytics Society
## Sports Analytics Challenge - Spring 2022

This event caters to Kenyon Sports Analytics Society members and should be accessible to all members, regardless of statistics experience. If you're not confident or you want some help, consider doing this as a pair project! We can't wait to see what you come up with! Remember, no stakes - we just want to see all the cool stuff that you come up with with this data!

## Format

- Participants will be given data in `.csv` form and `.rda` form. Both forms are identical.
- Allowed platforms for coding are R (using RStudio) or Python (in a Jupyter Notebook, including Google Colab).
- The competition will be hosted asynchronously, and your final solution should be provided as a single annotated file uploaded to the specified submission link. We recommend using R Markdown for R developers (might we suggest submitting an Rmd file) or using Jupyter Notebooks for Python developers (might we suggest submitting an IPYNB file). Click [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSduM6TRbxYDQOGe29LVBHCYPcOlIgpSx_gZ7ph4lX_DO0F2bQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to make your final submission.
- All submissions must be made by 12:00 PM EST on March 22, 2022.
- Participants are expected to do exploratory data analysis on the data, but beyond this, there are no expectations to the depth or breadth of analysis.
- Plagiarism of any form will lead to immediate disqualification.

## What should I include?

- Any exploratory data analysis code that you ran
- Any analysis code that you ran, including:
  - Hypotheses
  - Conditions checks for tests
  - The tests or analyses themselves
- Any code that you ran to get plots
- A conclusion

We ***highly*** recommend that you clear your environment and run your code all the way through before submitting. This will help you avoid calling undefined objects, which is the source of most errors. Code, notebooks, or files that do not execute or render properly will be disqualified.

You can use any packages that are available on CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) or which can be delivered by PyPI (using `pip`) or Anaconda (using `conda`). Judges will not install any packages from GitHub, GitLab, or any library repository other than CRAN, PyPI, or Anaconda. You do not need to include `install_packages()` statements in R or `pip install <package>` statements in Python. Judges will install all applicable packages, assuming that they are being loaded into your script by means of a `library()` statement in R or `import` statement in Python.

You may not submit any pre-compiled files, such as `.pyc` files. Your submission must be made in source code form. If compilation is required, it will be performed on the judge's machine.

## Scoring Matrix

How will I be scored?

| Your code executes with no errors.                                                                                                                                                                       | 5               |            |
| Your code is well crafted and documented, including comments and whitespace. All warnings are explained.                                                                                                 | 10              |            |
| The depth of analysis goes beyond the highest level of statistics or computer science coursework that you have completed. You have tried new things and learned something in the process.                | 10              |            |
| Your analysis is statistically correct. You have checked all conditions and proven that they are met, used the correct methods for what you are trying to accomplish, and drawn the correct conclusions. | 20              |            |
| **Total**                                                                                                                                                                                                | **50**          |            |
